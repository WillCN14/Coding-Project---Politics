What went well
For my first time really working on a long project like this I feel I produced a good body of work using the skills I have been working on these last couple months, There was some bumps in the road but overall I Understood the task which was at hand and completed it.

What could be improved 
I feel when it comes to coding again Ill learn from these first projects and look to improve on everything I have done, trying to shorten the code and looking to add more complex features that can add to the project. For my first serious project it went well however in the future I have stuff I should be looking to improve upon
